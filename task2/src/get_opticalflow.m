    % optical flow vectors are based on brightness constancy assumption:
    % i.e. take flow vector along which linear extrapolation of brightness gradients 
    % yields minimal change in brightness. The brightnessConstancyTerm 
    % below takes the direction of greatest change (along the brightness gradient)
    % for the average flow vector, and we subtract this from the average
    % flow vector to get more and more away from the direction of greatest change.
    % smoothness term models smoothness assumption: if field is smooth, 
    % optical flow vectors are scaled down less and can use more of
    % neighboring values
